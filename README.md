## Problem: Venue owners have trouble keeping track of all their bookings.
### User 1:  Tour Manager
*	Finding and booking venues
* Creating tours
*	Keeping track of bookings made
* Can favorite venues
### User 2: Venue Owner
*	Choose the venue that they own
* May create bookings
*	Do not have to worry about adding bookings made through the site to their page
### User 3: Anonymous User
*	Can only search for venues
*	Can access who has played at a venue recently
*	Can access the venues an artist has played at
*	Upon clicking on a venue an artist has played at, the process repeats
### Strategy: 
PluggedIn is a web application used to connect producers with independent artists who use Evenful as their primary venue searching platform. The site has 3 types of users: 
* Venue Owners: their profile contain information about their venue
* Tour Managers: their profile contains information about the artists they manage and their favorite venue(s)
* Anonymous Users: do not have a profile but may access artist information through a venue and venue inforamtion through an artist
* Our hope was to make it easier for Tour Managers to keep track of their tours, bookings, and favorite venues, and for Venue Owners to keep track of bookings made at their venue.
### API: Eventful
Eventful API allows you to add Eventful functionality to your site and search for content:
*	The API allows you can add a variety of Eventful features to your application. The features include: searching for venues, searching for venu owners, etc.
*	Use the API to search for venues matching specific topics, locations.
