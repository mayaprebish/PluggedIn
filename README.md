Strategy: PluggedIn is a web application used to connect producers with independent artists who use Youtube as their primary content platform. The site has two types of users: Producers, whose profiles contain information about their production company, signed artists, genre, location and contact information, and artists, whose profiles contain info about their Youtube channel, genre, location, and contact info. When artists search the site for producers, they will have access to information about the producers on the site, which can be filtered by genre or location. On the producer side, producers can search either from the users on the site, or from all artists on Youtube.
API: YouTube Data
YouTube Data API allows you to add YouTube functionality to your site and search for content:
•	The API allows you can add a variety of YouTube features to your application. The features include: uploading videos, managing playlists and subscriptions, updating channel settings, etc.
•	Use the API to search for videos matching specific search terms, topics, locations, publication dates, and much more. The APIs search.list method also supports searches for playlists and channels.
